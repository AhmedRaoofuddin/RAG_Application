# ðŸŽ‰ Guest Mode Enabled - No Login Required!

## What Was Fixed

Previously, when you created a Knowledge Base or uploaded documents, you were being redirected to a login page. This has been **completely removed**.

## Changes Made

### Frontend (`frontend/src/lib/api.ts`)
- **Removed automatic redirect to `/login`** on 401 responses
- API calls now continue seamlessly without authentication
- Guest mode is transparent - you won't even notice you're not logged in

### Backend (`backend/app/api/api_v1/auth.py`)
- Backend automatically creates and uses a **guest user** when no authentication token is provided
- No changes needed - this was already implemented!

## How It Works Now

1. **No Sign Up/Login Required**
   - Open http://localhost:3000
   - Start using the app immediately

2. **All Features Available**
   - âœ… Create Knowledge Bases
   - âœ… Upload Documents (PDF, TXT, MD, DOCX)
   - âœ… Ask Questions in Chat
   - âœ… View Citations and Sources
   - âœ… Generate API Keys

3. **Guest User Backend**
   - Backend automatically creates a "guest" user: `guest@fortes.local`
   - All your data is saved to this guest account
   - Everything persists in the SQLite database

## Using the App

### Quick Start
```bash
# Option 1: Use the batch file
start_app.bat

# Option 2: Manual start (2 separate terminals)
# Terminal 1:
start_backend.bat

# Terminal 2:
start_frontend.bat
```

### Access Points
- **Main App**: http://localhost:3000
- **Backend API**: http://localhost:8000
- **API Docs**: http://localhost:8000/docs

## What You Can Do Right Now

1. **Create Your First Knowledge Base**
   - Click "Knowledge Base" â†’ "New Knowledge Base"
   - Enter name: "My Documents"
   - Click "Create Knowledge Base"
   - âœ… No login required!

2. **Upload Documents**
   - Select your Knowledge Base
   - Click "Upload Documents"
   - Drag & drop or select files
   - Click "Upload"
   - âœ… Works perfectly without authentication!

3. **Start Chatting**
   - Click "Chat" â†’ "New Chat"
   - Select your Knowledge Base

## Technical Details

### What Happens Behind the Scenes

**Before (Broken):**
```
User creates KB â†’ Frontend sends request â†’ Backend returns 401
â†’ Frontend redirects to /login â†’ User can't proceed
```

**Now (Fixed):**
```
User creates KB â†’ Frontend sends request (no auth token)
â†’ Backend sees no token â†’ Creates/uses guest user automatically
â†’ Backend processes request â†’ Returns success
â†’ Frontend displays result â†’ âœ… Everything works!
```

### Guest User Details
- **Email**: `guest@fortes.local`
- **Username**: `guest`
- **Auto-created**: First time you use any API
- **Data Storage**: All your KBs, documents, and chats are saved
- **Persistence**: Data survives restarts (stored in SQLite)

## Stopping the App

```bash
# Use the stop script
stop_app.bat
```

Or manually:
- Close the terminal windows running backend/frontend
- Or press `Ctrl+C` in each terminal

## For Developers

### If You Want to Add Real Authentication Later

The authentication system is still there, just optional:

1. **Enable Login UI**: Uncomment login/register routes in frontend
2. **Require Auth**: Change `auto_error=False` to `auto_error=True` in `oauth2_scheme`
3. **Remove Guest User**: Comment out the guest user logic in `get_current_user()`

But for now, **guest mode makes development and testing much easier!**

---

## Summary

âœ… **Fixed**: Removed login redirect
âœ… **Result**: Guest mode - no authentication needed
âœ… **Status**: All features work without login
âœ… **Data**: Everything persists to database

**Just run `start_app.bat` and start building your Knowledge Bases!** ðŸš€
